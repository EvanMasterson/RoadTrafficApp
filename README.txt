The map by default is centered on the South Dublin area

You MUST allow location services in your browser (there should be a popup asking) for google maps to use your location and center the map onto your location and set your marker

If you do not allow location services, the map WILL work perfectly fine, it just WILL NOT center to your position for convenience
